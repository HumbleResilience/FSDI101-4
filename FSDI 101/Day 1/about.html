                Hello everyone! To start with My Bio, I was born and raised in a small town called Jonesboro in Arkansas. I can't wait to become a web developer, its exciting!
            
                I joined the Army when I was 21, and I served 6 years as an IT Specialist before getting out. I then went to college for Automotive Technolog. I ended up just learning for myself and didn't want to pursue that field.. 
                 
                Fast forward to the present day, I work at a PC repair shop currently. I'm currently attending a full stack web development course and I can't wait to improve myself!
            </p>
